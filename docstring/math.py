def comb(n, k):
    """
    Number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition.

    Evaluates to n! / (k! * (n - k)!) when k <= n and evaluates to zero
    when k > n. Also called the binomial coefficient because it is 
    equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of
    the expression (1 + x)**n.
    Raises TypeError if either of the arguments are not integers.
    Raises ValueError if either of the arguments are negative.
